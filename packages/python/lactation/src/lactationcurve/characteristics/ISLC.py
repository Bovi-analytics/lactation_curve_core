"""Interpolation using Standard Lactation Curves (ISLC).

This module implements the ISLC family of methods for estimating lactation
milk production from intermittent test-day records. The implementation follows
the CRV/ICAR approach based on Wilmink-style standard lactation curves and
correlation-based deviation corrections.

The main entry points are:
- ``ISLC_method``: compute a single lactation's estimated 305-d yield from
    interpolated grid measurements.
- ``ISLC``: apply ``ISLC_method`` per ``TestId`` in a pandas DataFrame.
- ``ISLC_original_method``: compute a single lactation's estimated
    305-d yield using the technique described in the original paper.
    Wilmink et al. (1987)
    "Comparison of different methods of predicting 305-day milk yield
    using means calculated from within-herd lactation curves"
- ``ISLC_original``: apply ``ISLC_original_method`` per ``TestId``
    in a pandas DataFrame.
- ``interpolation_standard_lc``: interpolate measured test-day yields onto
    the DIM grid using the standard lactation curve to guide slopes.
- ``linear_interpd_all_to_grid`` and ``linear_interpd_closest_to_grid``:
    alternative linear interpolation helpers.

Notes
-----
- Milk samples are often recorded on non-grid DIM values.
    Interpolation is therefore used to map measurements to grid days.
- Three interpolation variants are implemented.
    ``interpolation_standard_lc`` is recommended because it is the most
    consistent with the original method.
- ``interpolation_standard_lc`` requires a standard lactation curve.
    You can fit one with the ``lactationcurve`` package.
- The methods can be applied to lactations without any measurements,
    in which case the result will be the population mean from the standard curve.

            unique lactations (e.g., animal ID or lactation ID).

            This means that the entire input DataFrame will be treated as one lactation.
        standard_lc_305 (pd.Series | npt.NDArray[np.float64]): Standard

        max_dim (int | str): Maximum DIM to include in the analysis (default: 305).

        - The amount of estimated milk yields depends on the
            availability of measured milk yields.
        - Lactation yield is:
            sum(known measurements (p) + estimated measurements (q)).
        - In the implementation according to the CRV E2 document,
            there should also be a correction factor for the difference between
             the expected and actual complete lactation yield of the previous lactation.
            However, this correction factor is not included in the current implementation

    The function interpolates measured yields for one animal onto the
    predefined grid of DIM values. When a grid day coincides with a measured
    DIM the observed yield is used; otherwise the interpolation adjusts the
    linear slope between neighboring measurements by the difference in the
    standard curve, inspired by the CRV E2 approach.

    The interpolation formula applied for a grid day ``gday`` between two
    measured points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) is::

    Notes:
        - No interpolation is performed outside the range bounded by the
          first and last measured DIM for the lactation (those grid days are

                - No interpolation is performed for grid days where the right
